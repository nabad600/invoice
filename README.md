:crown: **Features**

:lock: Automatic HTTPS (:heart: [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/))  
:fire: NGINX webserver support [NGINX](https://nginx.org/)  
:hammer: Fully production-ready through docker-compose  
:pencil: Adjustable to your needs via environment variable  

## Quickstart V5 Launch

The dockerfile has been revamped to make is easier to get started, by default the base image selected in 5 which will pull in the latest v5 stable image.

```
git clone https://github.com/deck-app/invoiceninja.git
cd dockerfiles
```

Instead of defining our environment variables inside our docker-compose.yml file we now define this in the ```env``` file, open this file up and insert your APP_URL and your APP_KEY

```
APP_URL=http://localhost/
APP_KEY=<insert your generated key in here>
APP_DEBUG=true
MULTI_DB_ENABLED=false
DB_HOST1=db
DB_USERNAME1=ninja
DB_PASSWORD1=ninja
DB_DATABASE1=ninja
PHANTOMJS_PDF_GENERATION=false
```

The ```APP_KEY``` can be generated by running

```
docker run --rm -it invoiceninja/invoiceninja php artisan key:generate --show
```

Copy the entire string and insert in the env file at ```APP_KEY=base64....```

### Note for people running the container locally on their PC ###

If you are running the container locally, then the container will need to resolve the host, to support this you will want to insert your LAN IP address and the host name in the hosts file located in ```config/hosts```

For example, lets say your APP_URL is ```http://in5.test``` and your LAN IP is 192.168.0.124 the hosts file will have an entry looking like this:


```192.168.0.124 in5.test```

**Please note that PDF generation using local host your domain name MUST end in .test for your PDFs to generate correctly, this is a DNS resolver issue with chromium.

All that is left to do now is bring up the container


``` docker-compose up -d```


**Note: When performing the setup, the Database host is ```db```
